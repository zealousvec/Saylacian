# Session handoff

## Resume point

Read the owner's `SAYLACIAN_MASTER_DEVELOPMENT_DIRECTIVE.md`, `docs/IMPLEMENTATION_PROGRESS.md`, and this file first. Keep the approved black-and-white Kivy interface, prioritize verified functionality, and preserve unrelated user edits. Do not use mouse/keyboard control. Do not push, publish, tag, or release.

Repository: the current checkout of `zealousvec/Saylacian`
Branch: `main`
Public `origin/main`: `c4f2f87270c22a05e772816ce98e57a99b871b18`
Public CI: run `40087020450` passed on that commit.
Implementation commits ahead of public main: `63eca70f473c962663e00e8e82071cb3e405c8c3`, `76315cb`, `490750c64490ee283618e894754f5e5dff0b4510`, `0f0009ffeefd843300ad83f240aae25b8513f6b9`. This handoff and board are committed as a separate progress checkpoint.
No push has occurred. At session close, only the pre-existing uncommitted `docs/PROJECT_STATUS.md` and `docs/TECHNICAL_AUDIT.md` edits remain; preserve both user edits.

## This session

Implemented concise route labels and mode-specific picker choices. Removed a stale call to deleted `_choice_note`, which otherwise broke conversion. Added safe Borama/Kaddare copy menu actions named **Copy text**, **Copy image**, and **Copy Latin** on Windows; generic routes show only **Copy text**. The text action uses the existing versioned Saylacian Text package. Private-use text is not auto-detected; users can select Borama/Kaddare explicitly or paste the tagged package. Unknown/unlabelled input and invalid packages clear stale output. Tagged packages import, select the correct font and reconvert.

Updated pack/conversion wording and documentation for clipboard limits, chart mappings, and Unicode proposal status. Added the directive's task board, handoff, script interoperability note, Old Nubian source ledger/reader plan, Nubian research register, translation evaluation plan, update architecture, and UI copy register. A follow-up made the detection picker say **Detect** with a mode-accurate note. Added a direct regression for the RTF PUA glyph encoding, and removed unused imports; full-repository Ruff findings decreased from 35 to 30. Updated contributor and security guidance to match the public experimental-alpha status and avoid promising an unverified private reporting channel. Corrected stale roadmap entries for public Windows CI and the current Ruff count.

Live Kivy evidence: `%TEMP%\Saylacian-Autonomous-20261024-final`. `result.json` reports pass; screenshots cover Borama, Kaddare and packaged meaning output. No mouse or keyboard automation was used. KivyMD logs a deprecation notice for installed version 1.2.0; no framework upgrade was attempted. The real Windows clipboard test was not run: its read-only preflight found non-text clipboard formats, so the script would refuse before changing clipboard contents.

## Next three tasks

1. Complete visible-string review for dialogs, history, pack management, website templates, and GitHub-facing docs; correct outdated statements without touching unrelated owner edits.
2. Continue the Old Nubian source audit and design the smallest aligned text/transliteration reader; do not invent sample text or mappings.
3. Re-run the real clipboard matrix only after its safety check sees empty or text-only data; verify receiving apps and keep a restore path.

## Final verification results

- `pytest -q`: `87 passed, 66 subtests passed`.
- Live Windows Kivy `main.py --self-test`: passed; evidence is under `%TEMP%\Saylacian-Autonomous-20261024-final`.
- `compileall`, `ruff format --check .`, `pip check`, release-safety scan and `git diff --check`: passed. Changed presentation/clipboard modules and tests pass targeted Ruff; full `ruff check` reports 30 repository-wide findings.
- Real clipboard matrix: deferred because safety preflight found non-text clipboard data; no data was overwritten.

The pre-existing `docs/PROJECT_STATUS.md` and `docs/TECHNICAL_AUDIT.md` edits remain separate and must not be included in the commit.

## Local work and approvals

All implementation/documentation commits listed above are local only. The pre-existing changes in `docs/PROJECT_STATUS.md` and `docs/TECHNICAL_AUDIT.md` remain uncommitted and untouched. Public `main` still points to `c4f2f87270c22a05e772816ce98e57a99b871b18`; no push occurred. Explicit approval remains required before any push or public release action.
